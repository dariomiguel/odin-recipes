        <h2>Ingredients (Ferment)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>50g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>75ml of water</li>
            <li>15g frest yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon of sunflower oil</li>
            <li>50 ml water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, make the sponge by adding flour, water, sugar, and fresh yeast. Mix it gently until well combined, then cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 15 minutes. This will also help you determine if the yeast is fresh or not.</li>
            <li>On a clean kitchen counter, create a well by placing the flour and salt in a circle. Pour the water, ferment, and 2 tablespoons of oil into the center, then mix everything together from the center until a dough forms. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it's smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Grease a bowl lightly with oil, place the dough inside, and cover it for 30 minutes or until it doubles in size. Gently press down on the dough to release any air bubbles, then transfer it to a baking dish and bake it in a preheated oven at 210/250Â°C until golden brown. Once done, add sauce, cheese, etc. and enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
